        My name is Sébastien <a href="https://i.ibb.co/2ZYFdyF/spelling.png" style="text-decoration: none;"> Kerleau</a>,  I am a third year PhD student in computer science at <a href="https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/" style="color: white" target="_blank"> Université Paris Dauphine PSL</a>.

        <h1 class="text-to-tilt">About my thesis:</h1>
        Consider a function <b>f</b> that one needs to minimize. Assuming that a derivative exists, 
        gradient descent algorithms are usually applied, yet it may happen that information on the derivative of the function 
        is unavailable or takes a significant amount of time to be obtained. Such scenarios led researchers to creating 
        derivative-free optimization (DFO) algorithms. An emblematic case is given by the direct-search methods.
        Starting from a candidate <span class="latex">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>  for being the minimizer, the basic idea is to sample the objective function at a 
        finite number of points <span class="latex">\(\mathbf{x_1},\dots,\mathbf{x_s}\)</span> 
        around <span class="latex">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> at each iteration. Each point <span class="latex">\(\mathbf{x_i}\)</span> 
        is expressed as <span class="latex">\(\mathbf{x_i}=\mathbf{x}+\lambda\mathbf{v_i}\)</span> for some 
        vector <span class="latex">\(\mathbf{v_i} \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> and some parameter 
        <span class="latex">\(\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_+ \)</span> and depending on the sampled values
        <span class="latex">\(f(\mathbf{x_i})\)</span>, the value of <span class="latex">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> might 
        be changed at the next iteration. Assuming that the vectors 
        <span class="latex">\(\mathbf{v_1},\dots,\mathbf{v_s} \)</span> are 'well spread' in the space,
        the points <span class="latex">\(\mathbf{x_i}\)</span> are sufficiently dispersed around <span class="latex">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> at each iteration 
        and the algorithm should converge ! </br></br>

        Positive spanning sets (PSSs) can be defined as families of vectors able to span the Euclidian space through non-negative 
        linear combinations (equivalently, through positive linear combinations).
        Using  
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkas%27_lemma#Statement_of_the_lemma" style="color: white" target="_blank"> 
          Farkas' lemma</a>,
        one can also define PSSs as families of vectors that are not contained in a same half-space. In other words, PSSs
        can be defined as families whose elements are 'well spread' in the space ! </br> </br>
        <b>Drag around the vectors below to create your favourite PSS in <span class="latex">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> ! </b></br> </br>
         <div class="circle">
        <div class="radius"></div>
        <div class="radius"></div>

          All PSSs are not created equal: the speed of convergence of DFO algorithms will vary based on the collection of vectors given
          as an input. In particular, the cosine measure of the PSS seems to be an important factor: 
          start by finding a vector in <span class="latex">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> whose angle with its closest neighbor in your family
          is as large as possible. The cosine measure of the family is the cosine of this angle.
          For instance, the family formed by the four vectors above has a cosine measure of <span id="cosHalfMValue">-0.3162</span>.<br>
          Having a positive cosine measure is equivalent to being a PSS. Sets whose cosine measure is close to 1 are more popular
          in DFO algorithms as, roughly speaking, their elements are 
          extremely well spread in the space. <br>
          Creating PSSs with a large cosine measure can be done trivially as it suffices to consider families with a
          very large number of elements. In practice however, small PSSs are usually favoured in algorithms.
          <br> Did you notice ?
          A PSS of size 4 in <span class="latex">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> is usually not inclusion-wise minimal: 
          it contains a 'useless' vector which can be removed with no impact on the family's ability to positively
          span the Euclidian space.
          Inclusion-wise minimal PSSs are called positive bases.
          <p style="text-align: center;"><i>What is the size of a positive basis in <span class="latex">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>?</i></p>
          Weirdly enough, although linear bases all share the same size, positive bases do not: in n-dimensional spaces, 
          their size ranges from n+1 up to 2n !
          Using the tool above, can you create a positive basis of size 4 in <span class="latex">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> ? 
          Can you prove that positive spanning sets of size 5 in <span class="latex">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> 
          can never be inclusion-wise minimal ?
